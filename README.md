certain areas/walls are colored to match a particular season's colors to indicate how to progress
Backtracking will be a thing
GMTK dungeon maps to get a good feel for level design and how to encourage a player to explore(Time Allowing)

Alternate Design:
Use the three seasons (Spring, Fall, Winter) to determine the color palettes
there are places to time shift seasons
Gameplay is like fire emblem with a team of playable characters that are moved like chess pieces with abilities they can use(start simple expand as time allows)
Each enemy is colored in a way to indicate that if you make it to a season changing point you may be able to completely ignore the enemy if the season can be changed to right season, until someone changes it back
three enemy types: melee, ranged, AOE/Battlefield Altering
Player proceeds from battlefield to battlefield through an overworld, maze-
like map kind of like the original FF games or Dragon Quest games.

Premise:
The player is fighting for the protection of random forest that is important because trees are great but as the player progresses and removes baddies from the forest, the trees begin to make themselves helpful to the player in unexpected ways.
